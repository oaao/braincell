An annotated demonstration of a "single-neuron neural network" model, as a teaching/learning tool for the fundamental underpinnings of machine learning and (in contemporary, loose usage) AI.

Articulating the NN in 'atomic' unit-form highlights the lower-level statistical operations that are performed at the heart of machine learning: in short, "training" and "reasoning"


This is provided as a learning/teaching tool through which to develop an understanding of 

associative, collocative, adversarial etc.
